## Development setup

### Installing Node.js

Development is conducted using Node.js. You can download it from
[the official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/).

### Installing dependencies

You can install dependencies by running this command in the client root folder

```bash
npm install
```

### Running the client locally

Once you have Node.js and the dependencies installed you can run the client application locally by running this command in the client root folder

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

The application will automatically update once you save your code changes.

## Reporting a vulnerability

If you notice a security vulnerability in the application, please contact the Stagnum team through the GitHub
Security Advisory ["Report a Vulnerability"](https://github.com/EddieTheCubeHead/Stagnum/security/advisories/new)
feature.

If you are not reporting a security vulnerability, but instead a bug, please use our 
[issue tracker](https://github.com/EddieTheCubeHead/Stagnum/issues/new/choose).
